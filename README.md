*Autonomous Shopping Cart*

Autonomous shopping cart was a graduation project done by me and 4 other students. Project is intented to automatize the shopping process by a smart shopping cart which
follows the shopper in the aisles of the market and recogize the items put on the cart automatically.

Autonomous following part works with a computer vision system designed with opencv that returns distance and angle to an aruco marker attachted to the back of the customer.
Then controller executes steer and throttle commands to execute distance and angle errors.
